# 🫟 Spotted! Made by women, for women.
Find accessible washrooms. Instantly. Reliably. Stress-free.

Spotted is a location-based mobile app that helps users quickly find nearby washrooms with specific accessibility features, including, but not limited to, period products, baby-changing stations, wheelchair access, and gender-neutral facilities. Built with accessibility and equity in mind, Spotted aims to remove uncertainty and stress in urgent moments.

## 🧠 Why Spotted?

Access to clean, safe, and well-equipped washrooms is often taken for granted, but for many people, it’s a real barrier. Spotted addresses this by:

* Reducing uncertainty in unfamiliar spaces
* Supporting people who menstruate, parents, and people with disabilities
* Centralizing reliable, community-verified information

## 🔑 Key Features 

* **User-based feedback:** Add ratings for new/verified washrooms, score based on features like cleanliness, wheelchair accessibility, availibility of period products, etc.
* **Interactive map:** Users interact with pinned locations and view the average rating and score breakdown.
* * **Diverse range of needs:** Filter the map based on your accessible needs to find the most suitable washroom!
